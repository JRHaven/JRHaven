Hello! I am a Computer Science student at Luther College. I have been into software development since I was in Middle School
and am now carrying on that passion into my adult life! I publish almost all of the code that I write to GitHub, even though
some of it is messy and dirty. You will also find some antequated code here that I haven't touched in several years and don't
use anymore. But I like the idea of keeping it for archival purposes, so you can find it all here!

## Check out these repositories
Because there's a lot of old code here, here's some repositories you should check out if you want an accurate and up-to-date
description of how I program:
* [Weather-Displayer](https://github.com/JRHaven/Weather-Displayer) is the most active project of mine. It is a Python program that displays weather data from the National Weather Service.
* [Folder-Audio-Playlist](https://github.com/JRHaven/Folder-Audio-Playlist), though one of my more quick and dirty scripts, is an application I developed to suit my needs when volunteering running sound for a High School play.
* [Python-Projects](https://github.com/JRHaven/Python-Projects), though it does have quite a bit of junk in it, has some of the useful one-off scripts that I use. Check out some more recent scripts that were uploaded there to see what I mean.

## More about me
* **Contact information**: I prefer to be contacted via my email address, [jeremiah.r.haven@gmail.com](mailto:jeremiah.r.haven@gmail.com).
* **What I am learning**: I recently finished a Computational Models class and a Data Modeling and Querying class. I am currently in Internet Programming and Database Management Systems classes.
* **What I am working on**: College is keeping me *very* busy, but in my free time I've been working on optimizing my [Weather-Displayer](https://github.com/JRHaven/Weather-Displayer) project, including redesigning it with an Object-Oriented State design, as well as general bug fixes that come up.
* **Other things I do**: There's a lot more to me than just Computer Science. My other main passion is Music. I play the Trombone and Piano, and I perform at three main music ensembles at Luther College. In addition to studying Comptuter Science as a major at Luther College, I also minor in Music and German.
