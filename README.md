Hello! I am a Computer Science student at Luther College. I have been into software development since I was in Middle School
and am now carrying on that passion into my adult life! I publish almost all of the code that I write to GitHub, even though
some of it is messy and dirty. You will also find some antequated code here that I haven't touched in several years and don't
use anymore. But I like the idea of keeping it for archival purposes, so you can find it all here!

## Check out these repositories
Because there's a lot of old code here, here's some repositories you should check out if you want an accurate and up-to-date
description of how I program:
* [Weather-Displayer](https://github.com/JRHaven/Weather-Displayer) is the most active project of mine, and I am currently in the process of making it fully object-oriented
* [Folder-Audio-Playlist](https://github.com/JRHaven/Folder-Audio-Playlist), though one of my more quick and dirty scripts, is a pretty cool application of a need of mine while volunteering for a completely different subject matter: running sound for a High School play.
* [Python-Projects](https://github.com/JRHaven/Python-Projects), though it frankly does have quite a bit of junk in it, has some of the useful one-off scripts that I myself use, sometimes day-to-day. Check out some more recent scripts that were uploaded there to see what I mean.

## More about me
* **Contact information**: I prefer to be contacted via my email address, [jeremiah.r.haven@gmail.com](mailto:jeremiah.r.haven@gmail.com).
* **What I am learning**: I recently finished an Object-Oriented Programming with Java course, in which I learned a lot more about object-oriented programming and its benefits. I am currently in a highly theoretical Computational Models course involving Discrete Mathematics, Formal Languages, and Automata. I am also starting a Data Modeling and Querying course to learn more about database structures.
* **What I am working on**: College is keeping me *very* busy, but in my free time I've been working on optimizing my [Weather-Displayer](https://github.com/JRHaven/Weather-Displayer) project, including redesigning it with an Object-Oriented State design, as well as a design similar to an MVC design pattern.
* **Other things I do**: There's a lot more to me than just Computer Science. My other main passion is Music. I play the Trombone and Piano, and I perform at three main music ensembles at Luther College. In addition to studying Comptuter Science as a major at Luther College, I also minor in Music and German.
